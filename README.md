# bitstamp
Bitstamp application programming interface (API) allows our clients to access and control their accounts, using custom written software.

I am using public [bitstamp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitstamp).

A basic API wrapper for the Bitstamp REST API. Please refer to their documentation for all calls explained. Check out example.js for a list of all possible calls and their parameters.
